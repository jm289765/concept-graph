concept-graph is the server used by [concept-graph-web](https://github.com/jm289765/concept-graph-web). Don't use it for anything that's not localhost, it only uses http, not https.

Uses [Redis](https://redis.io/) for a database and [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) for search indexing/querying.

This project is a work in progress.
